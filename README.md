# hangman
Hangman is a word guessing game where one player picks a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. 
Each incorrect guess results in a part of a "hangman" being drawn.

In the game, the first player (the "word picker") chooses a word and indicates how many letters it has. The second player (the "guesser") then suggests a letter. 
If the letter is in the word, the word picker reveals its positions in the word. If the letter is not in the word, a part of the "hangman" (usually a gallows, rope, and stick figure) is drawn. The guesser continues to suggest letters until they either guess the word correctly or the hangman is completed. 
The game can be implemented in Java using various techniques, such as arrays to store the word and the guessed letters, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to display the hangman and the guessed letters.
